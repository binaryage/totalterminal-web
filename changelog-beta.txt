1.6 - September 28, 2015
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.11 (<a href="https://totalterminal.binaryage.com/#sip">but you have to disable SIP</a>). [El Capitan]
  - Dropped support for OS X 10.8. [Mountain Lion]

1.5.4 - October 15, 2014
  + It is newly possible to resize active Terminal window using hotkeys CMD+OPT+ARROWS (see the Window menu).
  * Visor sliding is newly implemented via animation groups instead of using an active loop (sliding is smooth even if you press hot-key during animation to reverse it).
  * When activating the visor window via a hot-key, the keyboard focus is transferred to Terminal.app as the first operation (this can help prevent rare problem of missing a quick keystroke after activating the hot-key).
  * <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/79">Prevent pulsing/flashing of scrollbars</a> after sliding the visor window.
  * Keyboard shortcut recording has relaxed conflicts detection. User is warned but has newly an option to set conflicting shortcut anyway.
  ! Additionally global keyboard shortucs which are disabled <a href="https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut/commit/0633545a4666d969dfbb860e540eb3b008893651">are no longer treated as conflicting shortcuts by TotalTerminal</a>.

1.5.3 - August 26, 2014
  ! Fixed <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/double-tap-activator-not-working-in-yosemite-dp5/2392">broken double-tap activation via modifier keys</a> (caused by a typo introduced in 1.5.2).
  * Do not auto-slide when preferences panel is visible.
  * It is newly possible to assign <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/cant-change-activation-key-to-control-esc/2417">CTRL+ESC, CMD+ESC and similar keyboard shortcuts</a>.

1.5.2 - August 14, 2014
  * Improved compatibility with OS X 10.10. [Yosemite]
  * Double-tap activation via modifier keys works more reliably (double tap is ignored if other key is pressed in between).
  * Status menu item is always displayed when in "run as background app" (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/97">discussion</a>).
  * Preferenes Window is raised above Visor window (easier to access when Visor is down).
  * More robust injection code.
  * Improved sliding animation code (works well on external displays under Yosemite). [Yosemite]
  ! Fixed applescript interface (was broken in 1.5 release).
  - Removed support animated backgrounds (I don't want to maintain that code).

1.5 - July 24, 2014
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.10. [Yosemite]
  * Double-tap activation via modifier keys reimplemented.
  * Old <a href="https://code.google.com/p/shortcutrecorder/">ShortcutRecorder</a> code replaced with <a href="https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut">MASShortcut</a> library.
  * Sharing more code with TotalFinder for easier maintenance.
  * Not forcing <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/99">Terminal icon in the Dock after launch</a>.
  - Removed support for OS X 10.7. [Lion]

1.4.11 - February 12, 2014
  ! Installer does not <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/totalterminal-update-overrides-script-name-breaks-webservers/897">leak environmental variables to newly launched Terminal.app</a>.

1.4.10 - January 23, 2014
  + Added new AppleScript commands to <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/how-to-toggle-visor-window-externally/1286">slide visor programatically</a>.
  ! Do not show Visor during startup (a regression introduced in 1.4.8)

1.4.8 - January 17, 2014
  + Introduced a new Screen preference option: "Screen with Mouse Cursor" <a href="https://github.com/iammattcoleman/totalterminal/commit/1c711b3522e0f248ac02834f247422483fb37817">by Matt Coleman</a>.
  ! Sparkle was <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/the-update-asked-for-my-password-why/838/6">asking randomly for password</a> when installing DMG. This fix will be effective since next update. With this update you might still be asked. Please enter empty string or anything.    

1.4.6 - November 05, 2013
  + Introduced a new preferences checkbox for <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/46">allowing switching between tabs via CMD+&lt;number&gt;</a>. The code was based on <a href="https://github.com/dabeeeenster/terminaltabswitching">this SIMBL project</a>.
  + Introduced a new preferences checkbox for auto-sliding Visor window on Terminal.app activation. Some people <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/86">want it</a> and some <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/50">don't</a>. Enabled by default.
  ! Properly set Visor window dimensions after <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/88">closing and opening Visor window again</a>.
  * Returned back to Visor window sliding implementation from versions 1.3.x. This should fix choppy sliding animations for <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/80">some</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/90">users</a>.
  * <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/87#issuecomment-27569130">Consistent behavior of auto-sliding</a> when one creates a new Visor window via CMD+N or reopening Terminal by clicking the Dock icon.

1.4.5 - October 31, 2013
  * Implemented new launcher similar to TotalFinder. We should not see <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/totalterminal-not-loading-on-startup-in-mavericks">AppleScript timeout errors on startup</a> anymore.
  * When activating Visor other Terminal windows are not brought to front (they do not change Z-level).
  ! Fixed transferring focus to Visor window when <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/1-4-4-doesnt-focus-on-visor-when-activated/717">there are other Terminal windows in play</a>.
  ! Fixed <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/delay-at-window-opening-since-1-4-x">delay when activating Visor via double-keypress</a>.

1.4.4 - October 26, 2013

  ! Fixed <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/totalterminal-lost-right-click-paste-after-upgrade-to-v1-4-3">broken "paste on right-click" feature</a>.

1.4.3 - October 25, 2013
  ! TotalTerminal properly launches TotalTerminalCrashWatcher for reporting crash reports to BinaryAge.

1.4.2 - October 24, 2013
  - Removed support for OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.9 Mavericks.

  + Added support for showing Visor via AppleScript.
  + TotalTerminal can switch Terminal.app into <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/3#issuecomment-26988325">UIElement mode</a> dynamically (removes the Dock icon).
  ! Properly unregisters hot keys when closing visor (fixes <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/53">#53</a>)
  * General cleanups and improvements (ARC, modern-ObjC) of the codebase (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/popavo">popavo</a>).

1.2.1 - February 21, 2012
  ! Fixed sublte timing bug when focus might not be returned to previous app after closing Visor (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/35">#35</a> introduced in 1.2).

1.2 - February 20, 2012
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.7.3 update.
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Preview 1. Visor fading is temporarily no-op - it was crashing the Window Server.
  + CMD+OPT+F will temporarily expand Visor to fullscreen and back (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/24">#24</a>)
  + Visor does AutoSliding&trade; - it slides down when Visor is the only terminal window and Terminal.app is activated via CMD+TAB or clicking on Dock icon (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/34">#34</a>).
  + Introduced TotalTerminalVisorForceHide plist tweak (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/21">#21</a>).
  ! Fixed colors configuration dialog under Snow Leopard (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/22">#22</a>).
  * If you pin Visor, switch to another app, return back and close Visor => focus is returned to another app, not the app which was active before you activated Visor.
  * Closing Visor when having selected other classic terminal window does not restore focus to previous app (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/26">#26</a>).
  * Do not close existing terminal windows on TotalTerminal launch.
  * Better detection of menu area. Prevents ocassional gap between Visor and top screen edge.

1.1.2 - August 9, 2011
  + Added checkbox "Show on top of the Dock" into TotalTerminal Preferences (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/16">issue</a>).
  ! Installer was launching TotalTerminal.app with wrong environment. This caused $TMPDIR to be set to non-existing folder (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/totalterminal_installer_setting_tmpdir_to_nonexisting_pkinstallsandbox">issue</a>).
  ! Fixed possible crash in CrashWatcher.
  * Prevents window flicker when hiding Visor, returning focus to previous app and there is other classic Terminal window.
  * Using 10.6+ APIs to set Visor Window to show on all Spaces if requested. Originally we needed some undocumented calls for Leopard compatibility.

1.1.1 - August 6, 2011
  ! Fixed crash when TotalTerminal tried to return the focus to an application which was not running anymore.
  ! Fixed random crashes when displays were reconfigured during Visor sliding.
  ! Visor Window width adapts to screen resolution changes (the bug was introduced in TotalTerminal 1.0).
  ! "Show on all Spaces" checkbox was ignored by mistake since 1.0.1 (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/10">issue</a>).
  ! Visor Window level decreased, so auxiliary windows are visible on top of it (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/15">issue</a>).
  * Visor properly returns focus to classic Terminal windows (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/13">issue</a>).

  * Added German and Chinese localization to crash dialogs.

1.0.2 - August 2, 2011
  + TotalTerminal includes <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/crashwatcher">CrashWatcher</a> - this will enable you to send me crash reports easily and helps me to improve TotalTerminal.

1.0.1 - July 31, 2011
  ! Fixed crash when closing Visor window (or exiting shell some other way).
  + After closing Visor window, a new Visor window can be simply created by hitting the key-combo again.
  + Added a button to Preferences pane to create Visor profile if it does not exist.
  + Reintroduced the pinning functionality. Pin state is sticky between terminal re-launches. You can redefine the keyboard shortcut in Preferences.
  + Double-key modifier can be changed by clicking on key images in Preferences.
  * Massive <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/commit/316f8731d962bb0bff6ec9e7eda352ad5177575e">code refactoring</a>. Hope reordering initialization code solved also few long-term timing bugs.
  * Redesigned TotalTerminal Preferences pane.
  * Now using <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/tree/master/totalterminal-plugin/SR">new code for recording keyboard shortcuts</a>. It should be more reliable.
  * Fixed window flickering when creating new Visor window.
  * TotalTerminal.app can be moved anywhere (~/.totalterminal config is not used anymore)
