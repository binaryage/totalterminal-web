  * Status menu item is always displayed when in "run as background app" (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/97">discussion</a>).
  * Preferenes Window is raised above Visor window (easier to access when Visor is down).
  * More robust injection code.

  * Double-tap activation via modifier keys reimplemented.
  * Old <a href="https://code.google.com/p/shortcutrecorder/">ShortcutRecorder</a> code replaced with <a href="https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut">MASShortcut</a> library.

1.4.10 - January 23, 2014
  + Added new AppleScript commands to <a href="http://discuss.binaryage.com/t/how-to-toggle-visor-window-externally/1286">slide visor programatically</a>.

  ! Sparkle was <a href="http://discuss.binaryage.com/t/the-update-asked-for-my-password-why/838/6">asking randomly for password</a> when installing DMG. This fix will be effective since next update. With this update you might still be asked. Please enter empty string or anything.    

1.4.6 - November 05, 2013
  + Introduced a new preferences checkbox for <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/46">allowing switching between tabs via CMD+&lt;number&gt;</a>. The code was based on <a href="https://github.com/dabeeeenster/terminaltabswitching">this SIMBL project</a>.
  + Introduced a new preferences checkbox for auto-sliding Visor window on Terminal.app activation. Some people <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/86">want it</a> and some <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/50">don't</a>. Enabled by default.
  ! Properly set Visor window dimensions after <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/88">closing and opening Visor window again</a>.
  * Returned back to Visor window sliding implementation from versions 1.3.x. This should fix choppy sliding animations for <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/80">some</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/90">users</a>.
  * <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/87#issuecomment-27569130">Consistent behavior of auto-sliding</a> when one creates a new Visor window via CMD+N or reopening Terminal by clicking the Dock icon.

1.4.5 - October 31, 2013

  * When activating Visor other Terminal windows are not brought to front (they do not change Z-level).

  * Updated status menu icons with retina versions (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal-i18n/pull/5">Rory Hardy</a>).

  ! Fixed <a href="http://discuss.binaryage.com/t/totalterminal-lost-right-click-paste-after-upgrade-to-v1-4-3">broken "paste on right-click" feature</a>.

1.4.3 - October 25, 2013

1.2.1 - February 21, 2012
  ! Fixed sublte timing bug when focus might not be returned to previous app after closing Visor (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/35">#35</a> introduced in 1.2).

1.2 - February 20, 2012
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.7.3 update.
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Preview 1. Visor fading is temporarily no-op - it was crashing the Window Server.
  + CMD+OPT+F will temporarily expand Visor to fullscreen and back (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/24">#24</a>)
  + Visor does AutoSliding&trade; - it slides down when Visor is the only terminal window and Terminal.app is activated via CMD+TAB or clicking on Dock icon (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/34">#34</a>).
  + Introduced TotalTerminalVisorForceHide plist tweak (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/21">#21</a>).
  ! Fixed colors configuration dialog under Snow Leopard (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/22">#22</a>).
  * If you pin Visor, switch to another app, return back and close Visor => focus is returned to another app, not the app which was active before you activated Visor.
  * Closing Visor when having selected other classic terminal window does not restore focus to previous app (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/26">#26</a>).
  * Do not close existing terminal windows on TotalTerminal launch.
  * Better detection of menu area. Prevents ocassional gap between Visor and top screen edge.

1.1.2 - August 9, 2011
  + Added checkbox "Show on top of the Dock" into TotalTerminal Preferences (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/16">issue</a>).
  ! Installer was launching TotalTerminal.app with wrong environment. This caused $TMPDIR to be set to non-existing folder (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/totalterminal_installer_setting_tmpdir_to_nonexisting_pkinstallsandbox">issue</a>).
  ! Fixed possible crash in CrashWatcher.
  * Prevents window flicker when hiding Visor, returning focus to previous app and there is other classic Terminal window.
  * Using 10.6+ APIs to set Visor Window to show on all Spaces if requested. Originally we needed some undocumented calls for Leopard compatibility.

1.1.1 - August 6, 2011
  ! Fixed crash when TotalTerminal tried to return the focus to an application which was not running anymore.
  ! Fixed random crashes when displays were reconfigured during Visor sliding.
  ! Visor Window width adapts to screen resolution changes (the bug was introduced in TotalTerminal 1.0).
  ! "Show on all Spaces" checkbox was ignored by mistake since 1.0.1 (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/10">issue</a>).
  ! Visor Window level decreased, so auxiliary windows are visible on top of it (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/15">issue</a>).
  * Visor properly returns focus to classic Terminal windows (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/13">issue</a>).
  - Removed Leopard-specific code. We no longer support OS X 10.5.

1.1 - August 3, 2011
  * Added German and Chinese localization to crash dialogs.

1.0.2 - August 2, 2011
  + TotalTerminal includes <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/crashwatcher">CrashWatcher</a> - this will enable you to send me crash reports easily and helps me to improve TotalTerminal.

1.0.1 - July 31, 2011
  ! Fixed crash when closing Visor window (or exiting shell some other way).
  + After closing Visor window, a new Visor window can be simply created by hitting the key-combo again.
  + Added a button to Preferences pane to create Visor profile if it does not exist.
  + Reintroduced the pinning functionality. Pin state is sticky between terminal re-launches. You can redefine the keyboard shortcut in Preferences.
  + Double-key modifier can be changed by clicking on key images in Preferences.
  * Massive <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/commit/316f8731d962bb0bff6ec9e7eda352ad5177575e">code refactoring</a>. Hope reordering initialization code solved also few long-term timing bugs.
  * Redesigned TotalTerminal Preferences pane.
  * Now using <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/tree/master/totalterminal-plugin/SR">new code for recording keyboard shortcuts</a>. It should be more reliable.
  * Fixed window flickering when creating new Visor window.
  * TotalTerminal.app can be moved anywhere (~/.totalterminal config is not used anymore)
