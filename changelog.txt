  * Double-tap activation via modifier keys reimplemented.
  * Old <a href="https://code.google.com/p/shortcutrecorder/">ShortcutRecorder</a> code replaced with <a href="https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut">MASShortcut</a> library.
  * Sharing more code with TotalFinder for easier maintenance.
  * Not forcing <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/99">Terminal icon in the Dock after launch</a>.

1.4.10 - January 23, 2014
  + Added new AppleScript commands to <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/how-to-toggle-visor-window-externally/1286">slide visor programatically</a>.
  ! Do not show Visor during startup (a regression introduced in 1.4.8)

1.4.8 - January 17, 2014
  + Introduced a new Screen preference option: "Screen with Mouse Cursor" <a href="https://github.com/iammattcoleman/totalterminal/commit/1c711b3522e0f248ac02834f247422483fb37817">by Matt Coleman</a>.
  ! Sparkle was <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/the-update-asked-for-my-password-why/838/6">asking randomly for password</a> when installing DMG. This fix will be effective since next update. With this update you might still be asked. Please enter empty string or anything.    

1.4.6 - November 06, 2013
  + Introduced a new preferences checkbox for <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/46">allowing switching between tabs via CMD+&lt;number&gt;</a>. The code was based on <a href="https://github.com/dabeeeenster/terminaltabswitching">this SIMBL project</a>.
  + Introduced a new preferences checkbox for auto-sliding Visor window on Terminal.app activation. Some people <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/86">want it</a> and some <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/50">don't</a>. Enabled by default.
  ! Properly set Visor window dimensions after <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/88">closing and opening Visor window again</a>.
  * Returned back to Visor window sliding implementation from versions 1.3.x. This should fix choppy sliding animations for <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/80">some</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/90">users</a>.
  * <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/87#issuecomment-27569130">Consistent behavior of auto-sliding</a> when one creates a new Visor window via CMD+N or reopening Terminal by clicking the Dock icon.

1.4.5 - November 02, 2013
  * Implemented new launcher similar to TotalFinder. We should not see <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/totalterminal-not-loading-on-startup-in-mavericks">AppleScript timeout errors on startup</a> anymore.
  * When activating Visor other Terminal windows are not brought to front (they do not change Z-level).
  ! Fixed transferring focus to Visor window when <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/1-4-4-doesnt-focus-on-visor-when-activated/717">there are other Terminal windows in play</a>.
  ! Fixed <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/delay-at-window-opening-since-1-4-x">delay when activating Visor via double-keypress</a>.

1.4.4 - October 28, 2013
  + Added preferences tweak to "Run Terminal.app as a background app". This allows <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/5">Visor sliding over fullscreen apps</a>.
  * Updated status menu icons with retina versions (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal-i18n/pull/5">Rory Hardy</a>).
  ! Auto-sliding after CMD+TAB takes place only if the Visor window is the only Terminal window in the system (<a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/two-problems-with-1-4-3">the bug report here</a>).
  ! Fixed <a href="https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/totalterminal-lost-right-click-paste-after-upgrade-to-v1-4-3">broken "paste on right-click" feature</a>.

1.4.3 - October 25, 2013
  - Removed support for OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.9 Mavericks.
  + New custom uninstaller (reused code from <a href="https://totalfinder.binaryage.com">TotalFinder</a>).
  + Added support for showing Visor via AppleScript.
  + TotalTerminal can switch Terminal.app into <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/3#issuecomment-26988325">UIElement mode</a> dynamically (removes the Dock icon).
  ! Properly unregisters hot keys when closing visor (fixes <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/53">#53</a>)
  * General cleanups and improvements (ARC, modern-ObjC) of the codebase (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/popavo">popavo</a>).
  * During TotalTerminal launch, existing Terminal windows are auto-closed unless Terminal process is old.

1.2.3 - May 10, 2012
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.7.4 update.

1.2.2 - March 05, 2012
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.7.3 update.
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Preview 1. Visor fading is temporarily no-op - it was crashing the Window Server.
  + CMD+OPT+F will temporarily expand Visor to fullscreen and back (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/24">#24</a>)
  + Visor does AutoSliding&trade; - it slides down when Visor is the only terminal window and Terminal.app is activated via CMD+TAB or clicking on Dock icon (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/34">#34</a>).
  + Introduced TotalTerminalVisorForceHide plist tweak (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/21">#21</a>).
  ! Fixed colors configuration dialog under Snow Leopard (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/22">#22</a>).
  * If you pin Visor, switch to another app, return back and close Visor => focus is returned to another app, not the app which was active before you activated Visor.
  * Closing Visor when having selected other classic terminal window does not restore focus to previous app (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/26">#26</a>).
  * Do not close existing terminal windows on TotalTerminal launch.
  * Better detection of menu area. Prevents ocassional gap between Visor and top screen edge.
  - Removed confusing option "Show on Reopen" from Preferences. AutoSliding is the only "right" behavior.

1.1.4 - October 18, 2011
  + Compatibility with OS X 10.7.2 update.

1.1.3 - August 10, 2011
  + Added checkbox "Show on top of the Dock" into TotalTerminal Preferences (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/16">issue</a>).
  ! Installer was launching TotalTerminal.app with wrong environment. This caused $TMPDIR to be set to non-existing folder (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/totalterminal_installer_setting_tmpdir_to_nonexisting_pkinstallsandbox">issue</a>).
  ! Finally fixed memory leaks in CrashWatcher (<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/crashreporter_starts_excessive_memory_consumption">issue</a>).
  ! Fixed possible crash in CrashWatcher.
  * Prevents window flicker when hiding Visor, returning focus to previous app and there is other classic Terminal window.
  * Using 10.6+ APIs to set Visor Window to show on all Spaces if requested. Originally we needed some undocumented calls for Leopard compatibility.

1.1.1 - August 6, 2011
  ! Fixed crash when TotalTerminal tried to return the focus to an application which was not running anymore.
  ! Fixed random crashes when displays were reconfigured during Visor sliding.
  ! Visor Window width adapts to screen resolution changes (the bug was introduced in TotalTerminal 1.0).
  ! "Show on all Spaces" checkbox was ignored by mistake since 1.0.1 (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/10">issue</a>).
  ! Visor Window level decreased, so auxiliary windows are visible on top of it (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/15">issue</a>).
  * Visor properly returns focus to classic Terminal windows (<a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/13">issue</a>).
  - Removed Leopard-specific code. We no longer support OS X 10.5.

1.1 - August 3, 2011
  ! Fixed crash when closing Visor window (or exiting shell some other way).
  + TotalTerminal includes <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/crashwatcher">CrashWatcher</a> - this will enable you to send me crash reports easily and helps me to improve TotalTerminal.
  + After closing Visor window, a new Visor window can be simply created by hitting the key-combo again.
  + Added a button to Preferences pane to create Visor profile with nice colors (if it does not exist).
  + Reintroduced the pinning functionality. Pin state is sticky between terminal re-launches. Also you can redefine the keyboard shortcut in Preferences.
  + Double-key modifier can be changed by clicking the key images in Preferences.
  * Massive <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/commit/316f8731d962bb0bff6ec9e7eda352ad5177575e">code refactoring</a>. Hope reordering initialization code solved also few long-term timing bugs.
  * Redesigned TotalTerminal Preferences pane.
  * Now using <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/tree/master/totalterminal-plugin/SR">new code for recording keyboard shortcuts</a>. It should be more reliable.
  * Fixed window flickering when creating new Visor window.
  * TotalTerminal.app can be moved anywhere (~/.totalterminal config is not used anymore)

1.0 - July 20, 2011
  + Lion compatibility.
  + Standalone installer.
  + Sparkle updater.
  + Custom icon modification.
  - Removed dependency on SIMBL. Now using <a href="https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal-osax">custom solution</a> similar to TotalFinder.
